# SQL-project---covid-analysis
In this SQL project, I will analyze the COVID-19 dataset starting from the beginning of its outbreak to extract interesting insights.

## Futur
I plan to combine the SQL output with Tableau to create interactive dashboards. This will allow me to visualize the pandemic trends worldwide and provide a more engaging way to explore the data.
